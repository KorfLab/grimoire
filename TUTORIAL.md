Tutorial: grimoire
==================

In this tutorial, you will
learn how to train HMMs, decode sequences, and compare annotations.
All the programs you will need are in grimoire/bin and all the data files
are in grimoire/data. Here's the road map.

1. Examining genome annotation with `calfo`
2. Sanitizing annotation files with `kalki`
3. Creating training and testing sets with `haman`
4. Building an HMM with `milwa`
5. Decoding sequences with `halito`
6. Comparing annotations with `latumapic`
7. Tuning for increased accuracy

Before we get to the walk-through, lets take a brief moment to review who
should and should not use this tutorial. This is a command-line tutorial.
We make the following assumptions:

+ You have enough Unix knowledge to modify your PATH and change permissions
+ You have enough Python knowledge to install grimoire and its dependencies
+ You will not email the authors asking for Unix/Python help

It is further assumed that you have an interest in _genomics_. If you don't
know what that means, you probably downloaded the wrong software. Here are
some expected users of grimoire.

+ You want to build a gene prediction program 
+ You want to identify potential errors in genome annotation
+ You want to model some kind of sequence feature
+ You want to develop something new and grimoire has some useful functions

OK, let's assume you're in the right time and place and continue.

1. Examining genome annotation with `calfo`
-------------------------------------------

2. Sanitizing annotation files with `kalki`
-------------------------------------------

3. Creating training and testing sets with `haman`
--------------------------------------------------

4. Building an HMM with `milwa`
-------------------------------

For debugging purposes, you should run `dumapic`.
For fun, you can generate sequences with `morlis`.

5. Decoding sequences with `halito`
-----------------------------------

6. Comparing annotations with `latumapic`
-----------------------------------------

7. Tuning for increased accuracy
--------------------------------

+ Lexicalized emissions
+ Optimal lengths of features
