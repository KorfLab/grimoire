Design Considerations
---------------------

The code is designed with the folllowing analyses in mind:

+ Gene structure prediction using hidden Markov models and variants
+ Genome annotation quality control

Programs:

+ milwa - HMM decoder (light)
+ lomilwa - GHMM decoder
+ halito - builds HMMs (little fire)
+ mahalito - builds GHMMs (big fire)
+ calfo - describes contents of genome annotation (x-ray vision)
+ dumapic - compares annotation (clarity)
+ morlis - grapher/emitter utility (fear)
+ malor - moves genes on chromosomes onto mini chromosomes (apport)
+ porfic - sanitizes the gff/gtf/bed12 to gff3 (shield)
+ latumapic - genome segmenter (location)
+ kandi - profile-HMM/alignment based gene finder (locate soul)
