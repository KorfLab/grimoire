The grimoire pacakage contains libraries and scripts for Biological sequence analysis.

Design Considerations
---------------------

The code is designed with the folllowing analyses in mind:

+ Gene structure prediction using hidden Markov models and variants
+ Genome annotation quality control

Programs:

+ milwa - reveals genes (light)
+ calfo/latumapic - describes contents of genome annotation (x-ray vision, location?)
+ kandi - finds specific genes (locate soul)
+ dumapic - displays HMM graphically (clarity)
+ halito - builds small HMMs (little fire)
+ mahalito -builds big models (big fire)
+ morlis - creates fake sequences (fear)
+ malor - moves genes on chromosomes onto mini chromosomes (apport)
+ porfic - sanitizes the gff/gtf/bed12 to gff3 (shield)
+ ?????? - compares predicted genes
+ ?????? - converts transcripts to CDS for those special models (lomilwa?)
