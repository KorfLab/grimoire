Design Considerations
---------------------

The code is designed with the folllowing analyses in mind:

+ Gene structure prediction using hidden Markov models and variants
+ Genome annotation quality control

Programs:

| Name      | Meaning    | Function                              |
|:----------|:-----------|:--------------------------------------|
| kalki     | blessings  | gff3 sanitizer (gff3io)
| milwa     | light      | hmm buider (forge)
| dumapic   | clarity    | hmm grapher (hmm_grapher)
| calfo     | x-ray      | genome reporter (fathom)
| halito    | fire       | hmm decoder (gene_finder)
