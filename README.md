grimoire
========

The grimoire pacakage contains libraries and scripts for Biological sequence analysis.

Disclaimer
----------

The current developent is highly volatile and not ready for public consumption.

Design Considerations
---------------------

The code is designed with the folllowing analyses in mind:

+ Gene structure prediction using hidden Markov models and variants
+ Genome annotation quality control
+ Structure-function relationships in sequences (e.g. IME)

Style
-----

+ Generally, follow the python style guide
+ Initial indents are with tabs not hard spaces
+ Docstrings are designed to look nice with pdoc3

Programs
--------

Program names are themed after spell names from the classic RPG
"Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord."
