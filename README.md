grimoire
========

The grimoire pacakage contains libraries and scripts for Biological sequence analysis.

Disclaimer
----------

The current developent is highly volatile and not ready for public consumption.

Design Considerations
---------------------

The code is designed with the folllowing analyses in mind:

+ Gene structure prediction using hidden Markov models and variants
+ Genome annotation quality control
+ Structure-function relationships in sequences (e.g. IME)


Programs
--------

Program names are themed after spell names from the classic RPG
"Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord."

| Name      | Meaning    | Function                               |
|:----------|:-----------|:---------------------------------------|
| calfo     | x-ray      | genome annotation reporter
| kandi     | locate     | genome annotation viewer
| haman     | change     | genome slicer
| milwa     | light      | hmm buider
| dumapic   | clarity    | hmm grapher 
| halito    | fire       | basic hmm decoder
| mahalito  | big fire   | 2-pass gene decoder
