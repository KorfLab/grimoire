Contributing
============

The code is in such a volatile state that I don't recommend trying to contribute unless you are actually part of the Korf lab. But if you're inspired, please get in touch.

Style
-----

+ Generally, follow the python style guide
+ Initial indents are with tabs not hard spaces
+ Docstrings are designed to look nice in plain text and with pdoc3
